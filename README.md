# scoreBoard
First front-end project. This is my attempt to improve my HTML, CSS and JS knowledge.

Scope:

The Scoreboard is a website where the user tracks games won and lost, and finds the overall winner (highest total score). 

The ScoreBoard Website at a basic level should have:
1. A table (done)
2. A link to the creator github (done)
3. The appearance reflects a gamer theme. (done)
4. Description of what the site does. (done)
5. Buttons that add to score. 

The table should have:
1. Is editable (done)
2. Size is editable (done)
3. Total is calculated from the sum of cells. (done)
4. Cells take appropiate values.
5. There is a limit on amount of rows and cells in table. (done)
6. Table is centered of screen no matter screen size. (done) 

Bonus for when I finish all other projects:
1. A back end - SQL and login.
2. Cookies.

Theme should have:
1. Table edited in CSS (done)
2. Background edited in CSS (done)
