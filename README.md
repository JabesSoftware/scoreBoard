# scoreBoard
First front-end project. This is my attempt to improve my HTML and CSS knowledge.

Scope:

The Scoreboard is a website where the user tracks games won and lost, and finds the overall winner (highest total score). 

The ScoreBoard Website at a basic level should have:
1. A table (done)
2. A link to the creator github (done)
3. The appearance reflects a gamer theme. 
4. Description of what the site does. 


The table should have:
1. Is editable (done)
2. Size is editable 
3. Total is calculated from the sum of cells.
4. Cells take appropiate values.
5. Cells changed to reflect handicap (colour to show level of handicap and score adjusted accordingly).
6. Table is centered of screen no matter screen size.

Theme should have:
1. Table edited in CSS
2. Background edited in CSS
3 Copyright somewhere on site
